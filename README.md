* This is an app called learnify which was focused on kids of age 3 to 9 years old. Our app had different sections for creating awareness among children related to ecosystem of lakes.
* This app mainly works in 5 different languages like English, kannada, Tamil, Telegu and Hindi so that the child can learn in its own local language. 
* Our app also had a chatbot(dialogflow) so that the child can know more about the biodiversity of lakes which worked in 4 languages like kannada, Tamil, English and Hindi.
* This App supports voice enabled features.
